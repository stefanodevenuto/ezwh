# Informal description
Medium companies and retailers need a simple application to= manage the relationship with suppliers and the inventory of physical items stocked in a physical warehouse. 
The warehouse is supervised by a manager, who supervises the availability of items. When a certain item is in short supply, the manager issues an order to a supplier. In general the same item can be purchased by many suppliers. The warehouse keeps a list of possible suppliers per item. 

After some time the items ordered to a supplier are received. The items must be quality checked and stored in specific positions in the warehouse. The quality check is performed by specific roles (quality office), who apply specific tests for item (different items are tested differently). Possibly the tests are not made at all, or made randomly on some of the items received. If an item does not pass a quality test it may be rejected and sent back to the supplier. 

Storage of items in the warehouse must take into account the availability of physical space in the warehouse. Further the position of items must be traced to guide later recollection of them.

The warehouse is part of a company. Other organizational units (OU) of the company may ask for items in the warehouse. This is implemented via internal orders, received by the warehouse. Upon reception of an internal order the warehouse must collect the requested item(s), prepare them and deliver them to a pick up area. When the item is collected by the other OU the internal order is completed. 

EZWH (EaSy WareHouse) is a software application to support the management of a warehouse.

# Stories and personas

Clara,47, has recently made a drastic change in her career recently transitioning to a company that sells mechanical components to other establishments, which she acquired the job of manager there. But to her surprise, she realized that the work in her new job is much harder since everything is done manually while she was used to an autonomous work bark in her old job. She was used to an implemented software which helps her handle orders coming from retail stores and track the transportation of the orders as well as giving frequent update to her clients about the shipment status. Clara would like to share her previous experience with this new company

Erzo ,30, is the Chief Executive of the marketing department inside of multibillion toy company.The main part of his job is to try the toys with his team so he can actually come up with an idea to attract kids towards buying their several products. However, everytime he has to ask for a toy from the warehouse he has to ask his superior to send an email to warehouse and he is not able to know when does the toys arrive to their headquarters. Erzo would prefer to have a direct contact with the warehouse, with possibly a tracking algorithm

Katia would really use a software that notifies her with the arrival of the products with the result of the tests that she performs

Lucy, 22, is part of the head quality team of a little firm that checks the specifications of each order arriving in his stockroom. As part of is mansion, she has to create all the needed tests on paper, perform the test and then report the result on the same sheet.

Fabio, 35, is the sytem administrator of Turbance, a company specialized in electronical components. The typical routine of his normal work day consists in keeping all in control, either the ebnormous amount of users in their system, along with his rights and permissions, and all the requests coming from them.
